# cpu-sim

This is just a personal project where I'm designing a CPU, so I thought I'd make a simulator. It might be able to be modified to simulate other architectures too (Mainly Simulator.java, change the microcode word bit definitions and generate your own microcode (I used a python script as it'd take ages by hand) in Microcode.java)

## Building

IDK really open up eclipse and run Main.java I really don't know.
